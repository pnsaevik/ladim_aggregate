# Spread data across multiple input and output files

bins:
  # We use the variable `farm_id` as a grouping variable across files. By
  # convention, the across-file-dimensions are usually placed on top.
  farm_id: group_by

  # We use a simple one-dimensional binning in the spatial direction
  X: {min: 0, max: 10, step: 2}

# The binning variable `farm_id` is split across multiple files.
filesplit_dims:
  - farm_id

# Multiple input files are specified using wildcards
infile: ladim_*.nc

# Output file in netCDF format. This is the name of the *main* dataset file.
# Since the binning variable `farm_id` is split across multiple files, there
# will be generated files named count_<firstFarmID>.nc, count_<secondFarmID>.nc
# and so on. The main dataset file contains variables that are common to all
# the subdatasets.
outfile: count.nc
