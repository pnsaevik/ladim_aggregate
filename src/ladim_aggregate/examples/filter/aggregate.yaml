# Filter out particles prior to aggregation

# In this example, we use a simple 1-dimensional binning
bins:
  X: [0, 50, 100]

# Here we specify the filter expression. This must be a valid numeric
# expression containing variable names defined in the input file. Valid
# operators include `&` (logical AND), `|` (logical OR), `~` (logical NOT),
# `==` (equality), `!=` (not equal) as well as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`.
filter: Y <= 60

# Here we specify which time steps should be a part of the aggregation, using
# a list of timestep indices. Step 0 is the first step. Negative steps are
# counted from the end, i.e., step -1 is the last step and step -2 is the
# second last step. (Negative indices do not work for multi-part input files).
filter_timestep: [0, -1]
