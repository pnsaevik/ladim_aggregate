# Compute connectivity between geographical locations

# The `geotag` parameters classifies variables according to their
# geographical location.
geotag:
  # GIS file of polygons, written in the .geojson format
  file: regions.geojson

  # We assume that the coordinates in the GIS files correspond to coordinates
  # in the ladim file
  coords:
    x: lon  # Name of the particle variable containing x axis coordinate values
    y: lat  # Name of the particle variable containing y axis coordinate values

  # Name of the GIS attributes which should be included.
  attrs:
  - region

  # Value to use if particle is outside the polygona
  outside_value: -1

bins:
  # Count the number of particles in each region, grouped by region
  region: group_by

  # The postfix INIT means the initial region of the particles
  region_INIT:
    edges: [-1, 101, 102, 103]
    labels: [-1, 101, 102]

# Find the distribution of particles with a certain age
filter: age == 2

# Input file in netCDF format (ladim output format)
