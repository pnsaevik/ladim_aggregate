# Sum up particles and group by time step

bins:
  # For performance reasons, time should usually be the first binning variable.
  # Here, we choose "group_by", which means that each unique time step gets
  # its own bin.
  time: group_by

  # The second grouping variable is "Z", with a resolution of 2.
  Z: 2
