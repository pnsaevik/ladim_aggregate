# Use a weighting variable, or import weighting from file

# In this example, we use a simple 1-dimensional binning
bins:
  X: [0, 50, 100]

# Here we specify the weights expression. This must be a valid numeric
# expression containing variable names defined in the input file.
# Variables imported from external files can also be used in the expression.
# In the expression below, `spec` and `super` is imported from a file
weights: mass * spec * super

# Import variables from file. The file is expected to be a netCDF file, with
# variables defined on a grid. Each particle samples the grid file variables by
# bilinear interpolation.
grid:
  - file: external.nc
    variable: spec
  - file: external.nc
    variable: super


outfile: count.nc
infile: ladim.nc
