# Complex example which illustrates many features at once

bins:
  # In this example, we use 5 binning categories, illustrating different ways
  # of specifying bins.

  # We don't specify bins for `farm_id` since it's already included in
  # filesplit_dims. A binning of the type "group_by" is added automatically.
  # farm_id: group_by

  # The variable `time` is also included in filesplit_dims, but here we show
  # that it's possible to include bins explicitly.
  time:
    # It's possible to specify bin edges and labels explicitly. Labels don't
    # have to be the number in the middle between the edges. In fact, they can
    # be anything.
    edges: [0, 366, 732]
    labels: [183, 549]

  # We can choose to specify only edges, in which case labels are automatically
  # chosen as the number in the middle between the edges. In this example,
  # edges are [0, 6, 12] and labels are [3, 9].
  Z: [0, 6, 12]

  # Instead of explicit edges, we can choose to specify min, max and resolution
  Y:
    min: 0
    max: 24
    step: 12

  # Or we can specify only resolution, in which case min and max is determined
  # from the values within the particle file
  X: 2

# The binning variables `farm_id` and `time`are split across multiple files.
filesplit_dims:
  - time
  - farm_id

# Here we specify the filter expression. This must be a valid numeric
# expression containing variable names defined in the input file. Valid
# operators include `&` (logical AND), `|` (logical OR), `~` (logical NOT),
# `==` (equality), `!=` (not equal) as well as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`.
filter: is_inside == 1

# Multiple input files are specified using wildcards. CAUTION: All files must
# be in the same format. In particular, the date format in all files must
# match.
infile: ladim_*.nc

# Output file in netCDF format. This is the name of the *main* dataset file.
# Since the binning variables `time` and `farm_id` are split across multiple
# files, there will be generated files named count_<timeval>_<firstFarmID>.nc,
# count_<timeval>_<secondFarmID>.nc and so on. The main dataset file contains
# variables that are common to all the subdatasets.
outfile: count.nc
