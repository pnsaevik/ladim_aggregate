# Sum up particles and group by time step

bins:
  # For performance reasons, time should usually be the first binning variable.
  time:
    # We can drop any of the min, max variables, in which case the program
    # performs a pre-scan of the input dataset to find min/max values
    min: 2000-01-02
    # max: 2000-01-05
    step: 1 days

  # The second grouping variable is "Z", with a resolution of 2.
  Z: 2
